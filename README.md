# OpenCyberForAll

**Skill-first, phone-first cybersecurity education for everyone.**

OpenCyberForAll is a free, public cybersecurity learning initiative created by **Shaydin Poonsamy**, whose own journey was built under the same constraints faced by many learners worldwide — limited resources, phone-first access, and no shortcuts.

This project exists to help under-resourced learners build **real cybersecurity skills**, not just theoretical knowledge.

## 🌍 Mission

To provide accessible, ethical, and practical cybersecurity education — from absolute basics to applied fundamentals — regardless of language, device, or background.

## 🧠 How Learning Works (Important)

OpenCyberForAll follows a **skill-first model**:

- ~30% understanding (clear explanations, real-world context)
- ~70% application (hands-on tasks, tools, analysis)
- Reflection and documentation to build thinking and proof

Learners are taught **enough**
